## Stakeholders

We interviewed one of Finn's roomates named Felix. Felix is an international student at NYU, who had to sublet his apartment this past summer and had some issues with the process. Some of these issues were finding a subleaser in the first place, problems with who would pay the utilities, and the subleaser trying to get out of their 'deal' early.

Goals/Needs: 
- sublet his nyc apartment over the summer
- effectively market/showcase his apartment to potential subletters
- find a trustowrthy and reliable subletter
- Get paid for the sublet
- Have a clear aggreement/set of terms - i.e. who pays utilities, start and end date, sublet cost, what happens in the case of damage, any other expectations...

Problems/Frustrations: 
- Sublet duration (and effectively payment) and utility coverage was not clearly defined, so the subletter failed to honor their initial agreement and he had no way to enforce it.
- Hard to find a subnletter, in some cases people have to go with a stranger which is potentially risky.
- If apartment leasers aren't aware that they need a sublet far in advance, they have to find one on short notice. This could mean potentially losing money on rent by  not finding a subletter in time, or rushing and getting an unreliable subletter. Also in some cases expectations/terms aren't fully understood and communicated by both sides, which can cause issues later. 
- The line of communication is not cohesive. There are a lot of details from initially connecting with the subletter, defining terms, agreeing on price and dates, and all aspects of the process are scattered not centralized in a way that makes it simple.

## Product Vision Statement

Sublit, we simplify subletting by providing a transparent and secure platform that connects renters with subletters in a streamlined process.
