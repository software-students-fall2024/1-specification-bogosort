## Stakeholders

We interview one of Finn's roomates named Felix. Felix is an international student at NYU, who had to sublet his apartment this past summer.

Goals/Needs: 
- sublet his nyc apartment over the summer
- effectively market/showcase his apartment to potential subletters
- find a trustowrthy and reliable subletter
- Get paid for the sublet
- Have a clear aggreement/set of terms - i.e. who pays utilities, start and end date, sublet cost, what happens in the case of damage, any other expectations...

Problems/Frustrations: 
- Sublet duration (and effectively payment) and utility coverage was not clearly defined, so the subletter failed to honor their initial agreement and he had no way to enforce it
- Hard to find a subnletter, in some cases have to go with a stranger who is potentially risky
- Didn't know he needed a sublet far in advance, so had to find one on short notice - this could mean potentially losing money on rent by either not having a subletter or not getting full rent back, rushing and getting an unreliable subletter, also rushing and expectations/terms aren't fully understood and communicated by both sides. 
- The line of communication is not cohesive, connecting with teh subletter, terms, price, dates, and all aspects of the ifnormation is scattered and not centralized in a way that meakes the process simple

## Product Vision Statement

Sublit, we simplify subletting by providing a transparent and secure platform that connects renters with subletters in a streamlined process

## User Requirements

1. As a nyu student that doesn't stay for summer, I want to sublet my apartment so that I'm not losing money on rent.

2. As a nyc summer intern, I want to find a shorterm rental so that I have a place to live during my internship.

3. As someone who has been scammed by a subletter before, I want to sublet my apartment to a trustworthy person so that I don't get scammed again. 

4. As a person that's never subletted before, I want to easily sublet my apartment so that I know how the process works. 

5. As an extremely busy person, I want an easy and simple way to connect with potential subletters so that I can sublet my apartment

6. As someone who doesn't ahve a lot of connections in nyc, I want a reliable way to find a sublet so that I can find the right apartment for my short term rental.
